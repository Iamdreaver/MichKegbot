--------------------------

  $ kegbot-admin.py kb_regen_events

**Core/General**

* Support for per-tap relay control (solenoid valve control for authenticated
  users.)

* Kegbot daemons now perform automatic log rotation, every night at midnight.
* When executed with ``--verbose``, daemons now show less spam.
* The drink "endtime" column has been removed (not user-visible).
* Flag names have changed; ``--api_url`` and ``--api_key`` now control the base
  API url and the API access key for any program which uses the Kegbot Web API.
* The "soundserver" application has been improved and once again works. Yay.
* Each keg record now has a "spilled" volume counter. This can be used to store
  the total amount of wasted or lost beverage which is not associated with a
  drink record.
* When running ``kegbot-admin``, ``PYTHONPATH`` now has higher precedence than
  ``/etc/kegbot`` and ``~/.kegbot``. This makes it possible to provide an

* The background image is now included in version control, and could be replaced
  locally.
* Beer type images rendering has been cleaned up.

**API**

* API keys are now calculated differently.  As a result, previously-used
  API keys are invalid.  To determine your API key, visit ``/account/`` while
  logged in as an admin user.
* System events are now exposed in the web api.
* Sessions are now exposed in the web api.
* Date/time fields reported in the web api are now always expressed in UTC,
  regardless of the system/Django time zone.

Version 0.7.8 (2010-12-01)
--------------------------
*Note:* Due to changes in the Kegbot core, you must run the following commands
after updating::
  
  $ kegbot-admin.py migrate
  $ kegbot-admin.py kb_regen_stats

*Note:* If you have installed using ``./setup.py develop``, you will need to
issue that command again; new versions of some dependencies are required.

**Core/General**

* Added SystemStats table.
* Now requires the ``pytz`` module; use ``pip install pytz`` to install.
* System, keg, session, and drinker statistics are now recalculated quickly
  after every pour.

**Kegweb**

* Added slightly more info to the "all-time stats" page.
* Used cached stats on the "all-time stats" page, making it more responsive.

  temperature sensor assigned to it.
* Fixed a crash on the keg admin page.

  chart could not be displayed; the chart is once again replaced with a
  descriptive error message.
* Fixed "known drinkers" statistic on the keg detail page.
* Set time zone UTC offset in ISO8601-formatted timestamps.  This fixes an issue
  where drinks appear to be poured in the future when the local timezone is
  behind the server timezone.
